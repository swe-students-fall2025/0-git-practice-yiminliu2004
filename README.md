## My Thoughts
What I find most interesting about this article is the idea that being a software engineer is like having your own project. You start from scratch, nurture it, and watch it grow into something meaningful. Along the way, the journey never really stops because technology is always evolving, and as engineers we keep learning and adapting to new tools and practices. That constant growth, both for the project and for ourselves, is what makes software engineering exciting and fulfilling.

I agree with the idea of constant growth that you mentioned. The article shows that being an engineer isn’t only about building something from scratch but also about improving, maintaining, and adapting projects over time. Each small program or project I work on feels like the start of huge project, and even if it’s simple now, I know it can continous work on it to make it something bigger.
